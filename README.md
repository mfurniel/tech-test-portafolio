| `npm run lint:css:fix`  | Automatically fix style linting issues          |

## Commitlint

This project uses **Commitlint** to enforce conventional commit messages.

### Configuration
Commitlint is configured with [`@commitlint/config-conventional`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional), ensuring standardized commit messages.

### Commit Message Structure
A commit message follows this structure:

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Commit Types

| Type      | Description                                                   |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **feat**  | A new feature                                                 |
| **fix**   | A bug fix                                                     |
| **docs**  | Documentation changes                                         |
| **style** | Code style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)             |
| **refactor** | Code changes without fixing bugs or adding features        |
| **perf**  | Performance improvements                                      |
| **test**  | Adding or updating tests                                      |
| **build** | Changes affecting the build system or dependencies            |
| **ci**    | Continuous integration configuration changes                  |
| **chore** | Maintenance tasks (build, CI, dependencies)                   |
| **revert** | Reverting a previous commit                                  |

#### Commit Example with Body and Footer

```bash
git commit -m "docs(core): improve commit message guidelines in README" \
-m "Expanded the commit message section with more details on optional body and footer usage. Also added examples for better clarity." \
-m "Related to issue #42"
```

## Husky Setup

In this project, we use **Husky** to set up **Git hooks** for pre-commit and pre-push actions. These hooks ensure code quality by running linting, tests, and build processes before committing and pushing changes.

### Pre-commit Hook

The pre-commit hook is configured to run the following commands before each commit:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm run lint` | Runs JavaScript/TypeScript linting to ensure code style and quality. |
| `npm run lint:css` | Runs CSS linting to check for issues with styles. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Runs end-to-end tests with Playwright. These tests are executed locally because we don't have a pipeline set up on the server. |

These checks help maintain the integrity of the codebase and prevent bad code from being committed.

### Pre-push Hook

The pre-push hook ensures that the build process runs before pushing any changes:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm run build` | Builds the project to ensure everything compiles correctly before pushing. |

### Commitlint

We also use **commitlint** to enforce proper commit message formatting. This is set up through Husky and ensures that all commit messages follow the conventional commit format.

For more details about commit message formatting, check the **commitlint** configuration in the project.

This setup helps maintain code quality and prevents breaking changes from being pushed without verification.


## Testing with Playwright

In this project, we use **Playwright** for end-to-end testing. Below are some useful commands you can run within the test directory:

### Playwright Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npx playwright test` | Runs the end-to-end tests. |
| `npx playwright test --ui` | Starts the interactive UI mode to run the tests visually. |
| `npx playwright test --project=chromium` | Runs the tests only on the Desktop Chrome browser. |
| `npx playwright test example` | Runs tests for a specific file. |
| `npx playwright test --debug` | Runs tests in debug mode to troubleshoot issues. |
| `npx playwright codegen` | Automatically generates tests using the Codegen mode. |

### Recommended Command

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Runs the end-to-end tests with Playwright in your environment. |

### Example Files

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `./tests/example.spec.ts` | Example end-to-end test. |
| `./tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.ts` | End-to-end tests for the Demo Todo App. |
| `./playwright.config.ts` | Playwright Test configuration. |
